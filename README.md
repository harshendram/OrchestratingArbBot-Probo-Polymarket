## 📊 Arbitrage Betting: An Introduction

Arbitrage betting is a risk-free strategy that takes advantage of price discrepancies across different betting markets for the same event. This bot specifically targets arbitrage opportunities between Probo (an Indian Rupee denominated market) and Polymarket (a USD denominated market) for prediction markets. By simultaneously placing complementary bets on both platforms, the bot aims to secure profits regardless of the outcome, capitalizing on momentary pricing inefficiencies. The key challenge in cross-currency arbitrage is managing the exchange rate risk, as fluctuations in INR/USD conversion rates can impact profitability.

  <p><em>Bot Architecture: How components interact to execute arbitrage</em></p>
</div>

This arbitrage bot operates on a simple yet effective principle:

1. **Market Data Collection**: Fetch market depths from both Probo and Polymarket
2. **Opportunity Analysis**:
   - Convert Polymarket's USD price to INR equivalent
   - Check if combined price of YES on Polymarket and NO on Probo < 100%
   - Calculate profit percentage and compare against minimum threshold
3. **Order Execution**: If viable opportunity is found
   - Place orders on both platforms simultaneously
   - Log execution and results
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Repeat at configured intervals

## ✨ Features

- **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage**: Automatically identifies arbitrage opportunities between Probo and Polymarket
- **Currency Conversion Management**: Handles INR/USD conversion with configurable exchange rates
- **Profit Threshold Control**: Configurable minimum arbitrage percentage to ensure worthwhile trades
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test the bot's decision-making without executing real trades
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs of opportunities and executions
- **Database Storage**: Records all identified opportunities and executed trades
- **Automatic Order Execution**: Places orders on both platforms when viable arbitrage is found
- **Risk Management**: Ensures >=0% profit on completed arbitrage trades (subject to exchange rate stability)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously checks for price discrepancies between exchanges
- **Retry Logic**: Handles temporary API failures with smart retries
- **Rate Limiting**: Avoids API restrictions through request throttling

## ⚠️ Risk Warning

While this bot aims to find risk-free arbitrage opportunities, please be aware that:

- **Currency Exchange Risk**: Since Probo uses INR and Polymarket uses USD, even a 1% change in exchange rates can eliminate profits from a marginal arbitrage opportunity
- **Market Liquidity**: Limited liquidity can affect order execution and realized profits
- **API Reliability**: Both platforms must have stable and responsive APIs for successful arbitrage execution
- **Execution Timing**: Price movements during order execution can impact profitability
